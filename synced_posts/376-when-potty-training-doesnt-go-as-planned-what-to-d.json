One minute your toddler is thrilled about their superhero underwear, and the next they’re hiding behind the couch to poop in a pull-up. If you’re in the middle of potty training chaos, you’re not alone. And no, you’re not doing anything wrong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s talk honestly about when potty training goes sideways—and how to reset without losing your mind (or your laundry).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">First: It’s Totally Normal to Hit a Wall</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every kid is different. Just because your friend’s kid was fully trained by 2 doesn’t mean yours will follow the same timeline. Some toddlers don’t show real interest until 3.5 or later, and that’s okay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes what feels like defiance is actually your child saying, <em>“I’m just not ready yet.”</em> And that’s fair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Potty Training Might Stall</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are a few common culprits:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Too much pressure</strong> (they can feel it—even if you’re being chill)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Big changes at home</strong> (new baby, new daycare, etc.)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Fear of pooping on the potty</strong> (it’s a thing!)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Constipation</strong> (often overlooked, but major)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Inconsistent routines</strong> (between home and daycare, for example)</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the “why” helps you take a breath and figure out the “what next.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Do Instead</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Take a Break—Seriously</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Put the potty stuff away for a week or two. No reminders, no pressure, just a reset. Sometimes the break is what both of you need.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Keep It Simple</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No need to reinvent the wheel. Maybe just add a fun potty book or bring back the sticker chart. Tiny changes go a long way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Make It Routine</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Turn it into a habit like brushing teeth. Try after meals, before bath, or when changing clothes. Keep the tone super casual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>Ease the Fear</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If they’re scared to poop on the potty, let them sit on it with their diaper on. Then try with the diaper open. Baby steps still count.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. <strong>Celebrate the Effort</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Clapping for just trying? Yes, absolutely. High five for sitting and wiping? 100%. Progress isn’t just dry pants—it’s building confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When to Ask for Help</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your child is past 4 and still hasn’t made much progress, or if you’re dealing with daily constipation or withholding, call your pediatrician. No shame in asking for support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Potty training is a big milestone, but it’s not a race. You’re not behind. You’re not failing. You’re learning alongside your child. Take it one puddle at a time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ve got this, mama. And if today was a pull-up day? That’s okay too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Created with love by </strong><a><strong>www.parentvillage.blog</strong></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
