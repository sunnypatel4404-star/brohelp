  "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The preschool years are magical… and messy… and sometimes a little chaotic. Starting preschool is a big milestone — for both your child <em>and</em> you! Whether it’s their first time in a classroom or they’re moving up from daycare, having the right gear makes mornings smoother and helps your child feel confident and prepared.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here’s my <strong>tried-and-true list of 10 preschool must-haves</strong>, complete with why they matter and what to look for — from one mom who’s been there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Sturdy Backpack (That Fits Them!)</strong> 🎒</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A backpack is more than a place to hold their stuff — it’s their “school identity.” It should fit comfortably on their back without dragging on the ground. Preschoolers don’t need a giant bag, but they do need enough space for a folder, change of clothes, and maybe a small lunchbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Look for padded straps, lightweight material, and zippers they can open on their own. Bonus points for a fun design that reflects their personality — dinosaurs, rainbows, glitter… whatever makes them smile.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> I once made the mistake of getting a “too cute” tiny backpack. By week two, the teacher was sending notes saying, “It won’t fit his lunch!” Lesson learned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/41vG2Tm\">Click here to see preschool backpacks</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Lunchbox They Can Open Themselves</strong> 🥪</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lunchtime is all about independence — and teachers don’t have time to open 20 tricky lunchboxes. Choosing one your child can open and close without help gives them confidence and keeps lunch stress-free.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Practice at home! Fill it with their usual snacks and let them try. A simple latch or zipper is best, and leakproof compartments are a plus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> We did a “lunchbox test” at the kitchen table. My daughter picked the one she could open the fastest — and she still uses it two years later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JaxQ4N\">Click here to see preschool lunchboxes</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Water Bottle with a Flip Straw</strong> 💧</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hydration is important, but so is avoiding spills in a backpack. A water bottle with a flip straw or spout is easier for small hands than a twist cap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Opt for a lightweight, BPA-free bottle with a spill-resistant lid. Test that your child can flip it open and close it securely.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> Always label it! I’ve seen a row of identical pink water bottles at pickup — and yes, mine came home with someone else’s once.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/47r1Gfe\">Click here to see preschool water bottles</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Extra Change of Clothes</strong> 👕👖</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Spills, art projects, and playground mud are part of preschool life. A full change of clothes (shirt, pants, underwear, socks) in a labeled bag means no emergency calls for parents to bring something in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Pack soft, comfortable, easy-to-change clothes in neutral layers so they work year-round.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> Rotate the spare set with the seasons — once I forgot, and my son wore shorts in December after a juice spill.

Non-Marking Indoor Shoes</strong> 👟</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some preschools require a separate pair of clean shoes for indoor play to keep floors clean and safe. Even if yours doesn’t, it’s a good idea.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Velcro closures are easier than laces for quick changes. Lightweight sneakers or slip-ons work well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> Pick a fun color or design they’ll be excited to put on — my daughter had unicorn sneakers she called her “magic shoes.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3UVqc0z\">Click here to see indoor shoes for preschoolers</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Weather-Ready Outerwear</strong> ☔🧥</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Preschoolers spend time outside year-round. Having the right coat, rain jacket, or sunhat means they can enjoy recess without getting soaked, cold, or sunburned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Look for easy fasteners (Velcro or snaps) and machine-washable fabrics. A hood is a must.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> Keep outerwear at school if allowed — we lost fewer coats once I stopped bringing them back and forth daily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4mlYkiw\">Click here to see weather-ready outerwear</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7. Comfort Item (If Allowed)</strong> 🧸</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first days (or weeks) can be a little overwhelming. A small comfort item can help your child feel safe and secure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Pick something small enough to fit in a pocket or cubby — like a tiny plush, a cloth with your scent, or a laminated family photo.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> My son had a small knitted bunny he kept in his pocket. Just knowing it was there made drop-offs so much easier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3UqKZsH\">Click here to see preschool comfort items</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8. Easy-On, Easy-Off Clothing</strong> 👗👖</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Independence in the bathroom is a huge part of preschool readiness. Clothing that’s simple to pull on and off helps avoid accidents and builds confidence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Elastic waistbands and simple pullovers are best. Avoid complicated straps, belts, or overalls unless they’ve mastered them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> Save the cute but tricky outfits for weekends. At school, it’s all about function.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/45qPAQM\">Click here to see preschool clothing essentials</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9. Label Everything</strong> 🏷️</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jackets, shoes, lunchboxes, even socks — if it can be left behind, it probably will be. Labeling saves you from replacing items every few weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Choose:</strong> Waterproof, washable labels last the longest. Permanent marker works in a pinch, but it fades quickly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> I even label snack containers — once you’ve dug through the “lost and found” bin, you’ll understand why.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4lpGCJt\">Click here to see washable name labels</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>10. A Positive Morning Routine</strong> 🌞</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not a physical item, but maybe the most important “must-have.” A calm, predictable routine sets the tone for the whole day.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Build It:</strong> Prep backpacks and lunches the night before, wake up with enough time for a slow start, and have a goodbye ritual.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>💡 <strong>Mom Tip:</strong> We do a “three kisses” goodbye — one for school, one for friends, one for fun. It’s our little tradition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Shop This Item:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4llw5yT\">Click here to see morning routine charts</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Preschool Prep FAQ</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q: When should I start buying preschool supplies?</strong><br>A: Aim to have everything ready at least 2 weeks before school starts. That gives you time to label items and do practice runs with your child.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q: How can I help my child adjust to preschool?</strong><br>A: Visit the school ahead of time, meet the teacher, and do short “practice mornings” at home with their backpack and lunchbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Q: Do I really need all 10 items?</strong><br>A: Every child and school is different, but these are the most common must-haves teachers recommend for a smooth transition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Made With Love by Parentvillage.blog</strong> 💛</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
