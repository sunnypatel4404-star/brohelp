But timing matters. Most pediatricians recommend starting complementary foods at about six months <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-what-and-how-to-introduce-solid-foods.html#:~:text=Your%20child%20can%20begin%20eating,Your%20child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cdc.gov</a>. Waiting until your baby can sit up and hold their head steady ensures they’re ready to swallow safely. I knew my daughter was ready when she grabbed my spoon at dinner, opened her mouth when offered a taste and didn’t immediately push it out with her tongue. Those little cues told me it was time to introduce new flavors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My favorite first foods (and how I served them)</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When picking your baby’s first foods, you don’t need fancy gadgets or store‑bought purées. I started with iron‑rich choices like oatmeal cereal mixed with breast milk, then moved on to homemade apple sauce and mashed sweet potato. Soft fruits like banana and avocado make perfect first bites—just mash with a fork and thin with a splash of milk. For protein, I pureed cooked chicken and lentils until velvety smooth. Offering a variety of flavors early on helps expand your child’s palate and ensures they get vitamins and minerals from different sources.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Purees versus baby‑led weaning</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’ve probably heard of baby‑led weaning—letting babies feed themselves soft finger foods instead of spoon‑fed purees. I took a hybrid approach. Purees let me gauge how much my daughter was actually eating, but around seven months I offered steamed broccoli florets, cucumber sticks and toast soldiers. She loved gnawing on them! Whichever method you choose, always supervise closely, use soft foods that can be squished between your fingers, and remember that gagging is normal while babies learn to move food around their mouths.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keeping meals safe and stress‑free</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your kitchen will be messy, but safety is non‑negotiable. Seat your baby upright in a high chair, never in a stroller or car seat. Avoid hard, round foods like whole grapes, popcorn and raw carrots; they’re choking hazards. Slice grapes into quarters and cook vegetables until soft. Offer tiny amounts of water with meals but continue breast milk or formula as your baby’s main source of nutrition until one year old. And don’t forget to let your baby lead—when they turn away or clamp their lips, they’re done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Allergens and adventurous eating</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I grew up believing you should avoid peanuts and eggs, but experts now say introducing common allergens early can actually decrease the risk of allergies <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-what-and-how-to-introduce-solid-foods.html#:~:text=How%20to%20introduce%20foods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cdc.gov</a>. At about six months, I swirled a small amount of peanut butter into yogurt and scrambled eggs with plenty of milk for softness. I watched her closely and waited three days before trying something else. Introducing new foods one at a time helps you spot any reactions and also gives your baby a chance to focus on each new taste.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Patience pays off</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Babies are curious but also cautious. They might spit out carrots one day and gobble them up the next. I learned not to take refusals personally. If my daughter pressed her lips together, I took a break and tried again a few days later. Repeated exposure is key; some foods need to appear on the plate many times before they’re accepted. Making mealtimes calm and pressure‑free allowed her to explore textures and flavors at her own pace.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Creating mealtime memories</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Introducing solids isn’t just about nutrients—it’s about family. Eating together helped my daughter see how we enjoyed food. We turned off screens, sat at the table and talked about colors and smells. She loved dipping her spoon into my bowl and “cheering” with her sippy cup. These shared moments made meals something to look forward to, not a chore.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Starting solids is a journey of discovery for both you and your baby. Trust your instincts, take cues from your child and have fun exploring new tastes together. And if you ever feel unsure, reach out to your pediatrician for guidance <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/infant-toddler-nutrition/foods-and-drinks/when-what-and-how-to-introduce-solid-foods.html#:~:text=Your%20child%20can%20begin%20eating,Your%20child\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cdc.gov</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",
